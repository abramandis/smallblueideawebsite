							<h3>11.1 Governing Law</h3>
							<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Montana, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

							<h3>11.2 Dispute Resolution Process</h3>
							<p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof shall be resolved through the following process:</p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Direct Negotiation:</strong> The parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through direct negotiation for a period of 30 days.</li>
								<li><strong>Mediation:</strong> If direct negotiation fails, the parties shall participate in mediation administered by a mutually agreed upon mediator or mediation service. The mediation shall be conducted in Flathead County, Montana, and shall last no more than one day unless both parties agree to extend it.</li>
								<li><strong>Arbitration (if mediation fails):</strong> Only if mediation fails to resolve the dispute, the matter shall proceed to binding arbitration in Flathead County, Montana, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by a mutually agreed upon alternative dispute resolution service.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>11.3 Arbitration Process</h3>
							<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a neutral arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if no agreement can be reached, by the AAA. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including injunctive relief. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.</p>

							<h3>11.4 Costs and Fees</h3>
							<p><strong>All Dispute Resolution Costs:</strong> All costs and expenses related to dispute resolution, including but not limited to mediator fees, arbitrator fees, filing fees, administrative fees, and attorney's fees, shall be borne entirely by the party initiating the dispute resolution process (the "Initiating Party"). Small Blue Idea, LLC shall not be responsible for any costs, fees, or expenses related to dispute resolution unless Small Blue Idea, LLC is the Initiating Party.</p>
							<p><strong>Cost Recovery:</strong> If Small Blue Idea, LLC is required to participate in dispute resolution initiated by the other party, Small Blue Idea, LLC reserves the right to seek recovery of all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, from the Initiating Party if the dispute is resolved in Small Blue Idea, LLC's favor.</p>

							<h3>11.5 Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action</h3>
							<p>By agreeing to arbitration, both parties waive their right to a trial by jury and their right to participate in any class action or representative proceeding. Any claim must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</p>

							<h3>11.6 Exceptions to Dispute Resolution Process</h3>
							<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in small claims court for disputes within the jurisdiction of such court (typically $10,000 or less), or seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm or preserve the status quo pending the dispute resolution process.</p>

							<h2>12. Severability</h2>
							<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

							<h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
							<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Small Blue Idea, LLC regarding the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals.</p>
