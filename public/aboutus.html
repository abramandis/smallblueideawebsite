								<p>Small Blue Idea is more than a software developer. Our core mission, ideas, and values center around 
								transforming the imagination into reality. We give a voice and hard work to ideas, small blue ideas, 
								that act as catalysts and seeds to something greater, towards those things that are real and tangible, 
								towards tools and platforms and services that effect real world change. It's our strong belief that in 
								order to change the world, you have to create, and it's for this art of creation that Small Blue Idea, LLC. 
								was created. Our primary business centers around the development of cutting edge, elegant software that rests 
								at the intersection of technology and design. However, our hearts are in the imagination, that kid like 
								imagination that so many of us lose through time.</p>
								<p> Founded by Abram Andis in 2014 with his best friend in a pizza shop, Small Blue Idea's charter, name, and logo 
								came to life. It was decided then that the primary function and business of Small Blue Idea, LLC. would be the 
								transformation of the imagination, of great ideas, into reality and this process would drive Small Blue Idea's 
								value in the world.</p>
								<p> Since then we have become a world class software development team working with the latest native platforms, AI, 
								and Machine Learning. Our first product "The Tomorrow Planner" is on the IOS App store and available for free 
								download. It showcases what can be done when a person commits his or her mind to knowing exactly what it is 
								they want to accomplish. After "The Tomorrow Planner" we have continued to create powerful software that just 
								'feels' different. This is because we understand what great technology is, and only work with the best tools, 
								languages, and platforms to ensure simple, bug-free design. As a result our software has become a reflection 
								of our drive to create products the world will love.</p>
								<p> If you have any questions regarding projects, employment, or great ideas that you would like to create, please 
								reach out to us! We would love to hear from you. And until then, Think Giant.</p>
